# Population EDA (1980-2050)

Population EDA is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that aims to examine and understand the patterns and characteristics present in a population.

## Description
Population EDA uses statistical techniques and visualizations to explore a population of data and identify valuable insights into its characteristics. The project involves data preparation followed by the exploratory analysis itself.

## Dataset:

The dataset has the following columns:

- **place:** Name of the country or region
- **pop1980:** Estimated population for the year 1980
- **pop2000:** Estimated population for the year 2000
- **pop2010:** Estimated population for the year 2010
- **pop2022:** Estimated population for the year 2022
- **pop2023:** Estimated population for the year 2023
- **pop2030:** Estimated population for the year 2030
- **pop2050:** Estimated population for the year 2050
- **country:** ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code of the country
- **area:** Total land and water area of the country (in square kilometers)
- **landAreaKm:** Land area of the country (in square kilometers)
- **cca2:** ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country
- **cca3:** ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code of the country
- **netChange:** Annual net change in population (in thousands)
- **growthRate:** Annual population growth rate (as a percentage)
- **worldPercentage:** Percentage of world population
- **density:** Population density (in persons per square kilometer)
- **densityMi:** Population density (in persons per square mile)
- **rank:** Rank of the country by population

## Goal:

My goal will be to find out:

- Add up all country populations and plot a graph over the years
- The 10 most populated countries of each year
- The 10 least populated countries of each year
- 10 countries that had a drastic change between years
- 10 countries with the highest population growth
- 10 countries with the lowest population growth
- Population density by country
- World population percentage
